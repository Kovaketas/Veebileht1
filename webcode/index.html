    <h2>Who I am</h2>
    <p>My name is Berit Aun, and I’m an aspiring artist from the beautiful country of Estonia. Ever since I can remember, I’ve been drawn to creativity and self-expression, and over time, art has become a powerful way for me to explore and communicate my thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Growing up surrounded by Estonia’s rich culture, natural landscapes, and quiet charm has deeply influenced the way I see the world and how I choose to express that vision through my work. I'm still learning and evolving every day, but I'm passionate about developing my skills and finding my unique voice as an artist. </p>

    <h2>Why I do art</h2>
    <p>Honestly, the reason I started doing art was because of a competition. I've always had this drive to be the best at everything I try, and when I saw one of my friends drawing, something inside me clicked. I felt this sudden urge to prove that I could do it too. Maybe even better. What started as a challenge quickly became something much more meaningful. As I spent more time with a pencil or brush in hand, I began to truly enjoy the process. There was something calming and rewarding about creating something from nothing, turning a blank page into a reflection of my thoughts and emotions. Over time, that competitive spark turned into a genuine passion, and art became a constant in my life. Something that continues to inspire and motivate me every day.

    <h2>My art journey</h2>
    <p>I started my art journey when I was just 10 years old, and ever since then, drawing has been a constant part of my life. It began with simple sketches and doodles, but quickly turned into something much more meaningful. No matter where I was, whether sitting in class, daydreaming with a pencil in hand, or relaxing at home during my free time, I always found myself drawn to art. It became a way for me to express myself, to process the world around me, and to explore my imagination. Over the years, I've continued to practice whenever I get the chance, using any spare moment to improve my skills and challenge myself creatively. What started as a hobby has grown into a true passion, and I can't imagine my life without it.</p>

    <h2>My art process</h2>
    <p>I don't follow the traditional route of digital art. Rather I do digital painting which is more akind to traditional paintings. The main benefit of using digital software for drawing is the layer function, but I keep it to the minimum for my art process. It's not that I don't use it, I just don't see the need of using it that much. Naturally with everything on the same layer the process becomes a bit messy, that's the kind of look I am trying to achieve. </p>
